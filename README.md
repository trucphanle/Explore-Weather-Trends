# Explore-Weather-Trends
## Project Instructions
### Summary
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends in Munich, Germany to overall global temperature trends.

### Instructions
I will create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Munich, the closest big city to where I live. To do this, I will perform the following steps:

- **Extract the data** from the database. There's a workspace in the next section that is connected to a database. I exported the temperature data for the world as well as for Munich by writing a SQL query to interact with the database in Udacity course program.
  - I wrote a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV as city_data and city_list.
  - I wrote a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV as global_data.
- **Open up the CSV** in Excel or Google sheets, but you are welcome to use another tool, such as Python or R.
- **Create a line chart** that compares Munich temperatures with the global temperatures. I plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
- **Make observations** about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. This part is presented in a pdf file named Project1_Ex.WeatherTrends_TrucPhan_Revised.pdf. Here are some questions I will consider:
  - Is Munic hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
  - “How do the changes in Munich's temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
  -  What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
